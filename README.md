Datasets for PaM2020 "Building a Swedish Question-Answering Model" (Paper link to be added)

This repository contains the datasets for Swedish and Spanish question-answering generated from the [SQuAD dataset](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) using the novel cross-lingual projection method introduced in our PaM2020 paper.

They can be used to train an NLP model for extractive question answering, such as Multilingual BERT. Check out the [Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) for more details.

When used to train Multilingual BERT, the Spanish dataset achieves a new state of the art in the XQuAD and MLQA question-answering benchmarks.
